Plant Mod Design

Soil Types - One per module, perhaps an ascended variant if module veers into the strong side.

Farmland Types - One per soil.

Modules - Controlled by isLoaded()
Types as follows:
-Applied Energistics
-Blood Magic
-Botania
-Cosmetic (Base Module, CFG but defaults on always)
-Embers
-Roots

Registry Heirarchy - For random af organizational purposes.
All blocks are created in their respective packages. Base classes in the parent, but module classes in type.module
Registration has to be handled through the respective module class, then through the item/block classes for handling.
Then all is passed to the GlobalRegistry which falls into the Proxies.
