Plant Mod Design

Soil Types - One per module, perhaps an ascended variant if module veers into the strong side.

Farmland Types - One per soil.

Modules - Controlled by isLoaded()
Types as follows:

Addon Modules:
-Applied Energistics
-Blood Magic
-Botania
-Embers
-Roots

Base Modules
-Cosmetic
-Hostile
-Meme (Disabled by default for obv reasons)

Registry Heirarchy - For random af organizational purposes.
All blocks are created in their respective packages. Base classes in the parent, but module classes in type.moduletype.module - ex: (blocks.addon.botania)
Registration has to be handled through the respective module class, then through the item/block classes for handling.
Then all is passed to the GlobalRegistry which falls into the Proxies.




Plant Types - Listed as thought of randomly.
Bushes that produce on right click, propertyBool true/false hasFruit, worldgen only.
